# how to make your own computercraft video!
be warned, videos will be black and white!
1. go to https://github.com/Axisok/qtccv
2. click `<> Code â–¾`
3. click `ðŸ—Ž Download ZIP`
> if python is not installed, install python 3.11 (or any version of your choice, this tutorial just uses 3.11) from [here](https://python.org/downloads), making sure to enable "add python 3.11 to PATH" in the installer.
> 
> once python is installed, open cmd and type `pip install numpy` and then `pip install moviepy`
4. extract the zip you downloaded wherever you want
5. find a video you want to use
> the file size needs to be pretty low, aspect ratio should be 7:4 (70 x 40)
6. go into the unzipped folder
7. go into the `encode` folder
8. place your video in the `encode` folder
9. shift + right-click in the file explorer window
10. press `Open PowerShell window here`
11. in powershell, type `py encoder.py -c quadtree -i <video file> -o <output file>.qtv` (MUST have .qtv)
> this will not work if you didn't add python to path. you can do this after installation by opening the start menu and searching `edit environment variables` and clicking on `Edit environment variables for your account`.
>
> once there, double click on the `Path` entry in the top. on the right, click `New` and then enter your python installation path (default is `%localappdata%\Programs\Python311`).
>
> you will also need to add the `Scripts` folder inside of the python folder (default is `%localappdata%\Programs\Python311\Scripts`).
12. once the file finishes encoding, move it into the `sample` folder
> if you want, you can delete `badapple.qtv`, but SAVE `playbadapple.lua`, you can change the name of `playbadapple.lua` but DO NOT DELETE IT
13. now you're going to make a github repository. you can call it whatever you want, just make sure it's public
14. upload the `decode` and `sample` folders to github
> uploading to github will not work if the qtv file is over 25 MB due to github's restrictions
>
> speaking of which, computercraft has a default memory limit of 1 MB, however this can be changed by editing the mod's config
15. go inside of the `sample` folder on github
16. edit `playbadapple.lua`, changing the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Axisok/qtccv/master/` link to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[YOUR USERNAME]/[REPOSITORY NAME]/main/`
> make sure you change `master` to `main`, github's default branch name is main
17. change all mention of `badapple` to whatever your qtv file is called and delete the line that mentions `badapple.nbs`
> for example, if it says `badapple.qtv`, the new version should say `video.qtv` if your qtv file is called `video`
18. go to [pastebin](https://pastebin.com)
19. paste the contents of `playbadapple.lua` (or whatever you called it if you renamed it) into pastebin
20. create the paste and then copy the last part of the link (the pastebin id)
> for example, `AaBb1234` from `https://pastebin.com/AaBb1234` (not a real link)
21. go into a computercraft computer with a monitor attached and type `pastebin run [pastebin id]`
> monitors must be 8 blocks by 6 blocks for 70 x 40 videos
22. you should see your video show up on the monitor!
> if not, double check that the github link in the pastebin is correct and that you correctly replaced all of the `badapple` mentions
>
> if it still doesn't work, it could be an issue with computercraft memory (which you can change in the mod config) or your qtv file is simply too big
